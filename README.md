    - If you use Win EDU or Enterprise you may have an error appear, just ignore, restart app, then click auto detect.
    - If you already have winrar installed it MIGHT piggyback off of it (which is fine). Not 100% sure though.
    - Unrar is the cli version of winrar. (https://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm)
- Click Auto Detect
- Select Game profile
- Drag desired mods to Desktop\CZT Mod Installer\mods_go_here (they can be extracted already or still be zip, 7z or rar. CZT will handle it all)

Features:
- Multi game profiles
- Smart extraction (can handle zip, 7z, rar, and even already extracted mods)
- Compatible with community mod loaders like melon loader for schedule 1.
- Launch with or without mods (useful for games like RoN that block PC players from joining console players due to mods being installed)
- Auto Detect Paths for Source, Tool, and Selected Profile. (please let me know if any of these fail)
- Buttons to browse all location of mods, source folder, game folder, and unrar install.
